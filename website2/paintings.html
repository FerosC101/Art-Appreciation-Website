                    <p>
                        Considered by some to be the "Mona Lisa of the North," this enchanting painting by the Dutch artist, Johannes Vermeer, features exactly what the title infers - a Girl with a Peal Earring.<br>
                        Completed circa 1665, this piece can now be found in the Mauritshuis Gallery in the Hague.

                        Any list of Most Famous Paintings would be incomplete without the mention of the Mona Lisa by Leonardo da Vinci.<br> 
                        This infamous portrait of Lisa del Giocondo was completed some time between 1503-1519 and currently on display at the Musee du Louvre in Paris.

                    <p>
                        Inspired by the bombing of Guernica, Spain, during the Spanish Civil War, Pablo Picasso completed this most famous piece, Guernica, in 1937. <br>
                        This piece was originally commissioned by the Spanish government and intended to depict the suffering of war and ultimately stand as symbol for peace.

                    <p>
                        Easily touted as Gustav Klimt's most famous painting, The Kiss is a realistic yet geometric depiction of a kissing couple, completed in 1908 in Vienna, Austria.<br>
                        What makes this piece different than the other oil paintings on the list is that it also incorporates gold leaf on canvas (in addition to oils).

                    <p>
                        In its native Dutch tongue, De Nachtwacht is most popularly referred to in modern culture as The Night Watch.<br> 
                        Using oil on canvas, Rembrandt (van Rijn) was commissioned by a militia captain and his 17 militia guards in 1642 to paint their company, in an effort to show off for the French Queen that would be visiting.
