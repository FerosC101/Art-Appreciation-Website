        <h1>Painting History</h1>
        <p>Painting emerged in prehistory, when nomadic people made use of paintings on rocky walls. 
        They made drawings with charcoal leaving marks in the caves where they passed. 
        Recent discovery made in Spain found that the oldest paintings discovered to date, made by humans, were made more than 42,000 years ago.

                <p>prehistoric art is all art produced in preliterate, prehistorical cultures beginning somewhere in very late geological history, and generally continuing until that culture either develops writing or other methods of record-keeping, or makes significant contact with another culture that has, and that makes some record of major historical events.</p>
